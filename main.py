Creating a smart energy monitor involves integrating various components to track and optimize energy consumption. Given the scope of the project, I'll provide a simplified version of the system. This version will simulate real-time energy data, store it, and provide some basic optimization suggestions. In a real-world application, this would involve integrating with hardware and using more sophisticated algorithms. Here, we'll focus on the software aspect using Python.

You'll need a few libraries to help with the task: `paho-mqtt` for simulating IoT communication, and `pandas` for data handling.

```python
import random
import time
import json
import traceback
import pandas as pd
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

# Define global variables
ENERGY_DATA = []
MQTT_BROKER = "mqtt.eclipse.org" # Public MQTT Broker for testing
MQTT_PORT = 1883
MQTT_TOPIC = "home/energy"

# Simulate energy data
def generate_energy_data():
    """ Simulate energy data for different home appliances """
    return {
        "timestamp": pd.Timestamp.now(),
        "appliances": {
            "heating": round(random.uniform(0.5, 3.0), 2),
            "cooling": round(random.uniform(0.5, 3.0), 2),
            "lighting": round(random.uniform(0.1, 0.5), 2),
            "electronics": round(random.uniform(0.2, 1.0), 2)
        }
    }

    try:

            energy_data = generate_energy_data()
            ENERGY_DATA.append(energy_data)
            print(f"Publishing data: {energy_data}")
            client.publish(MQTT_TOPIC, json.dumps(energy_data))
            time.sleep(5)  # Publishing every 5 seconds
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in publishing energy data: {e}")
        traceback.print_exc()

# Callback when the client receives a CONNACK response from the server
def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
    if rc == 0:
        print("Connected to MQTT Broker!")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to connect, return code {rc}")
        
# Callback when a PUBLISH message is received from the server
def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
    try:
        print(f"Received message: {msg.payload.decode()}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error handling incoming message: {e}")
        traceback.print_exc()

    total_electronics = sum(d['appliances']['electronics'] for d in data)
    
    suggestions = []
    
    if total_heating > total_cooling:
        suggestions.append("Consider lowering the thermostat for heating.")
    if total_cooling > total_heating:
        suggestions.append("Consider raising the thermostat for cooling.")
    
    if total_lighting > 0.3 * len(data):

### Explanation:

#### Simulating Energy Data:
1. **`generate_energy_data` Function**: Simulates energy consumption for different appliances. In a real IoT setup, this data would come from sensors.
   
#### MQTT Communication:
2. **`publish_energy_data` Function**: Sends simulated energy data to an MQTT broker. Uses `paho-mqtt` to handle the connection and data transmission.

3. **`on_connect` and `on_message` Functions**: Handle MQTT client connections and incoming messages, respectively.

#### Error Handling:
4. Used try-except blocks around critical operations (e.g., publishing data, processing incoming messages) to catch and print errors without crashing the program.

#### Data Collection and Analysis:
5. **`optimize_energy_usage` Function**: Analyzes collected energy data and provides basic optimization suggestions.

This program serves as a basic structure to simulate and track IoT-based energy monitoring. For a real-world application, it needs to be integrated with hardware sensors, secure MQTT connections, and in-depth analytics tools.
